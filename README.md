# QuantomBotCore
Embarking on the Mission Project for Radical AI, the primary objective of QuantomBotCore is to facilitate my learning of Firebase, Node.js, Visual Studio Code, and Postman in order to develop and deploy API endpoints. These tasks are comprehensive and will culminate in certification upon successful completion.
